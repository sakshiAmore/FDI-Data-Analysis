📘 Overview
This dataset provides a sector-wise breakdown of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in India over the period 2000–01 to 2016–17. FDI has been a key driver of India's economic growth, facilitating capital formation, technology transfer, and employment generation.

Between 2000 and 2017, India underwent substantial policy reforms and witnessed major shifts in global economic trends. These factors significantly influenced the volume and sectoral distribution of FDI inflows.

The dataset enables analysis of how various sectors have performed in attracting FDI, and how policy changes and global economic conditions have shaped investment behavior over time.

📌 Notes
FDI values may be reported in INR crore or USD million. Ensure clarity based on the data source.

Some sectors may include sub-sectors (e.g., "Construction Development" vs. "Infrastructure").

The dataset may be sourced from government records (e.g., DPIIT, RBI) or international organizations (e.g., UNCTAD).

🔍 Interpretation Guide
High FDI sectors (e.g., Services, Telecom, Automobiles) often align with liberalized policies and high growth potential.

Fluctuations may reflect policy bottlenecks, global financial crises (e.g., 2008–09), or geopolitical shifts.

Use year-on-year comparisons to evaluate sector-specific trends or sudden investment surges/dips.
